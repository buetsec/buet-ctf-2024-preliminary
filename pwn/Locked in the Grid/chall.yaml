  You managed to escape Noxhaven’s high-security prison once, but luck wasn’t on 
  your side—you were caught again. This time, they've thrown you into the infamous 
  Citadel, a place no one has escaped from. The prison’s security is old, but don’t 
  underestimate it. To break free, you'll need to dig into the past. Sometimes, old 
  systems hold the key to freedom...
