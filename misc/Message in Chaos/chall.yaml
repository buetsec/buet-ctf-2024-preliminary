  You received a file from a friend, but when you opened it, the contents 
  appeared to be nothing but gibberish. Your friend became defensive when 
  you mentioned it. However, you suspect that there might be hidden information 
  within the chaotic text. Can you uncover the secret behind this seemingly 
  random data?
hints:
  - Does each character appear the same number of times in the file?
