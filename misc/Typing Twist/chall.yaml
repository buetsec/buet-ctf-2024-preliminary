  I just picked up a custom cyber-deck keyboard from a sketchy chor bazaar. 
  It’s sleek, but when I tried to type, everything came out as nonsense. 
  After messing with it for a while, I realized there’s something special here, 
  I just need to figure out how it works.
hints:
  - The keyboard isn't malfunctioning, just unique—learning its rhythm is key.
  - The layout seems... unconventional, may be compared to what you're used to.
