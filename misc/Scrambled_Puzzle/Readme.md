Flag Format: BUETCTF{SECRET-HERE}

- [Scrambled-Puzzle.png](./Scrambled-Puzzle.png)
- [Key.txt](./Key.txt)

# Solution:
Extract the embedded 7z file form [Scrambled-Puzzle.png](./Scrambled-Puzzle.png) and unzip it with the [Key.txt](./Key.txt). You'll get another Image. Now decode the [Key.txt](./Key.txt) by mapping both of the images.
