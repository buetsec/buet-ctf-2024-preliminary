Alpha and Zara, two competitive classmates from a prestigious university, often collaborated on various projects. One afternoon, Alpha received a mysterious email from Zara with the subject line: ‚ÄúYou need to see this. Can you unlock the maze?‚Äù

Intrigued, Alpha opened the email, which contained two images. Zara believes there‚Äôs something hidden within these images that holds the key to solving a complex puzzle. Your task is to help Zara unlock the maze by analyzing the images for hidden clues or messages.

Can you find the secret within the images and guide Zara through the maze? Good luck!
