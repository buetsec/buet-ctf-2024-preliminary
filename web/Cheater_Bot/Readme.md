### Challenge Description:

Itâ€™s 2050, and AI is really taking over the world. For years, these smart systems have been threatening humans in all sorts of ways. Recently, I had a run-in with one of them that stole my data and challenged me to beat its game bot to get it back. Now, I need help figuring out how to outsmart this AI in its own game. 

Shoutout: A special shoutout to [CodingNepal](https://www.codingnepalweb.com) for their open-source game code!
