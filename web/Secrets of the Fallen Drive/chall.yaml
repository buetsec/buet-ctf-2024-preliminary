  In Noxhaven, where tech has fallen and the streets are ruled by silent engines 
  and hidden eyes, whispers tell of Paul Walker’s garage holding a crucial flag. If you 
  can convince the system that your ride is registered to his exclusive service, 
  you might unlock this lost key to the city's underground circuit.
hints:
  -  Paul’s system knows which cars are registered. Look for how the site tracks its members! (Penalty - 15)
