description: |-
  The Guild of Culinary Magic entrusted me with their ancient recipe scrolls, 
  and I’ve set up a magical portal for safe access. You can browse the spells 
  (or recipes), and even add new ones if you're worthy. It's all sealed with 
  powerful magic... or is it?
hints:
  - Hint 1: Search through all the enchanted scripts carefully (Penalty - 10)
  - Hint 2: Magical cookies can be altered, but don’t underestimate their simplicity (Penalty - 5)
