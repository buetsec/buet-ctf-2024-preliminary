  A new file has emerged in the depths of Noxhaven’s underground—a mysterious 
  upgrade to the old format(Echoes in the Dark). This one supports three colors and compresses data 
  with raw binary. However, it's tricky to read, and the resolution is capped 
  at 256x256 pixels. Can you decode what this file holds?
hints:
  - Hint 1: The resolution is stored in two bytes. (Penalty - 10)
  - Hint 2: The ternary is encoded in raw binary. (Penalty - 10)
