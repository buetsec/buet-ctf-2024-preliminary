  A mysterious .nocap file has surfaced in Noxhaven, a relic from before The Fall. 
  The tool to view it is lost, but whispers suggest it holds crucial information. 
  The file contains only black-and-white data. Can you figure out what it reveals?
hints:
  - Hint 1: Remember, .nocap files are binary--they only represent black or white pixels. (Free Hint)
  - Hint 2: Focus on the first two numbers in the file--they might tell you something crucial. (Penalty - 10)
