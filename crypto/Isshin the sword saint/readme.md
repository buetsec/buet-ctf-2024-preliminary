I have absolutely no idea why I came up with this name. Partly because of the Sekiro video I was watching
before coding this problem. And partly because I absolutely adore how isshin always beats the living soul
(it's a From Soft game after all) out of Sekiro, just like he's going to beat the living shit out of my flag this very moment.
